                information to begin the adoption process. All information about
                adoptable animals and their respective organizations is sourced
                directly from the third-party Petfinder API.

                Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services

                through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be finally and
                exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
