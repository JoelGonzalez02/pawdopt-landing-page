              This app is dedicated to the loving memory of my cat, Robin.
            </p>
            <p>
              In late 2021, I lost my best friend, Robin. For 7 years he was my
              constant companion, often purring on my lap or watching me work as
              I began to build the very first version of this app. He was there
              for the start of this journey, and his memory is what insipired me
              to finish it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built every feature with the goal of bringing the same love and
              companionship he gave me, and I gave him, to as many people and
              pets as possible.

              As a software engineer with experience at multiple companies, I
              wanted to apply my skills to a problem I care about deeply: Using
              technology to make the adoption process more fun and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              The love for animals that Robin inspired in me continues to be a
              driving force in my life and in the development of this app.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope to hear many stories of people finding their pet companions
              through Pawdopt.
