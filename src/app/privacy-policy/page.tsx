              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
                setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
